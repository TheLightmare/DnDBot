# DnDBot

Discord bot made using discord.py API.

The goal is to make a bot for playing DnD-style game within Discord.
The main features will be :
- DnD character creation
- playing with friends
- travel and explore the world
- hand-crafted dungeons, quests and adventures
- randomly generated dungeons and quests
- fully-fledged combat system for PvE and PvP (both in teams and solo)

I will also try my best to implement a real sense of freedom and "crafting your own stuff". 
For example making an alchemy system, allowing the creation of a potion of love, that you throw on a goblin so he becomes your friend.
Or even crafting your own weapons and tools.
